# CommunicationApp4Emergency
We want to develop an application that can respond to emergency situations in real time.
In Israel the situation is such that there are many emergency situations every day, and the emergency organizations have to be ready and respond to a number of situations at the same time.
Since an emergency situation requires an immediate response, then we want to meet the need of a citizen's real-time reporting of that emergency.
The application will require initial identification after its download to verify that there is a real person behind it and not a bot, after that when reporting an event it will be possible to choose whether it is an event that requires immediate treatment or an event that can wait until it is treated and then choose an organization, or the number of emergency organizations to which the report is intended .
An event that requires immediate treatment will have the appropriate features for it, an event that is delayed in terms of reporting will have the appropriate features for it.
